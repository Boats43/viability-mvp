\## Empirical Verification of the Viability Law



A delayed adaptive system was simulated with fixed initial conditions and stochastic perturbations.



For α ≤ 1.0, the system failed immediately due to insufficient corrective response.

For α > 1.0, the system maintained bounded divergence and entropy above the minimum threshold for the full simulation horizon.



At α = 1.005, the system remained viable for 200 steps with no collapse.



This demonstrates a sharp viability threshold consistent with the Viability Law:

correction must strictly exceed divergence to sustain persistence.
